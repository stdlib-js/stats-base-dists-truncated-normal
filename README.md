    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

# Truncated Normal

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][test-image]][test-url] [![Coverage Status][coverage-image]][coverage-url] <!-- [![dependencies][dependencies-image]][dependencies-url] -->

> Truncated normal distribution.



<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import truncatedNormal from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/stats-base-dists-truncated-normal@deno/mod.js';
```

You can also import the following named exports from the package:

```javascript
import { pdf } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/stats-base-dists-truncated-normal@deno/mod.js';
```

#### truncatedNormal

Truncated normal distribution.

```javascript
var dist = truncatedNormal;
// returns {...}
```

The namespace contains the following distribution functions:

<!-- <toc pattern="*+(cdf|pdf|mgf|quantile)*"> -->

<div class="namespace-toc">

-   <span class="signature">[`pdf( x, a, b, mu, sigma )`][@stdlib/stats/base/dists/truncated-normal/pdf]</span><span class="delimiter">: </span><span class="description">truncated normal distribution probability density function (PDF).</span>

</div>

<!-- </toc> -->

The namespace contains the following functions for calculating distribution properties:

<!-- <toc pattern="*+(entropy|kurtosis|mean|median|mode|skewness|stdev|variance)*"> -->



<!-- </toc> -->

The namespace contains a constructor function for creating a [truncated normal][truncated-normal-distribution] distribution object.

<!-- <toc pattern="*ctor*"> -->

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
import objectKeys from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/utils-keys@deno/mod.js';
import truncatedNormal from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/stats-base-dists-truncated-normal@deno/mod.js';

console.log( objectKeys( truncatedNormal ) );
